# Machine Learning Pipeline for predicting Radio Galaxies

This set of Notebooks are designed to create a pipeline of Machine Learning  
models for predicting the detection of Radio Galaxies and their redshift values.  

## Folder Description

This folder includes lists of indices to identify the elements of each sub-set in HETDEX. This allows avoiding running data splitting every time.
